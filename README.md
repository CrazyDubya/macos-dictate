## Usage

### Running the Script

Ensure your virtual environment is activated:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Run the script with your desired model size:

```bash
python dictate.py --model base
```

Replace `base` with the desired Whisper model size (`tiny`, `base`, `small`, `medium`, `large`).
The base model is enabled by default if you don't use the `--model` tag.

The base model uses about 400 to 500 megabytes of system RAM. The small model increases that by 400 to 500 mb. Use `Activity Monitor` to monitor RAM & CPU usage to find a model that has no system impact while left running persistenly.

### Start Dictation

- Press the **F1** key (default trigger key) to start recording (press **fn** + **F1** if you haven't set function keys to override mac controls (the symbols on the function keys like brightness, volume, etc.)).
- You will receive a notification indicating that recording has started.

### Change Trigger Key

You can customize the trigger key for starting and stopping dictation. For instructions on how to change the trigger key, refer to the [Change the Trigger Key](#change-the-trigger-key) section in the Configuration part of this document.

### Stop Dictation

- Press the **F1** key (default trigger key) again to stop recording.
- You will receive a notification indicating that recording has stopped.
- The transcribed text will be automatically pasted into the active application.

---

## Creating a Clickable Application on MacOS

You can create an application that you can double-click to start the dictation tool without opening Terminal manually.

### Option 1: Using AppleScript

#### a. Open Script Editor

- Open **Script Editor** by searching for it in Spotlight (press `Cmd + Space` and type "Script Editor").

#### b. Write the AppleScript

Paste the following script into the editor:
(New as of 241206)

```applescript
-- Prompt the user to choose a Whisper model size
set modelSizes to {"tiny", "base", "small", "medium", "large"}
set defaultModel to "base"
set chosenModel to choose from list modelSizes with prompt "Select Whisper model size:" default items defaultModel

if chosenModel is false then
	display alert "No model selected. Exiting."
	return
end if

set modelSize to item 1 of chosenModel

-- Direct path to the Python interpreter in your virtual environment
set pythonPath to "/Users/tristangardner/.pyenv/versions/3.12.7/envs/venv/bin/python"

-- Path to your Python script
set scriptPath to "/Users/tristangardner/Documents/Programming/01_Apps/macos-dictate/dictate.py"

-- Build the command to use zsh to ensure proper environment loading
set shellCommand to "zsh -l -c " & quoted form of (pythonPath & " " & scriptPath & " --model " & modelSize)

-- Run the Python script in the background without opening Terminal
do shell script shellCommand & " >/dev/null 2>&1 &"
```

#### c. Save the Script as an Application

- Go to **File** > **Export**.
- Set **File Format** to **Application**.
- Name it `Dictate`.
- Choose **Applications** as the location.
- Click **Save**.

**Instructions:**

## Running the Tool at Startup

You can configure the dictation tool to run automatically when you log in.

**Note:** Be cautious when setting scripts to run at startup. Ensure that the script does not require user interaction at startup, or it may hinder the login process.

### Steps:

1. **Create a Launch Agent**

   Create a property list file (`.plist`) in the `~/Library/LaunchAgents` directory.
2. **Create the `.plist` File**

   Open Terminal and run:

   ```bash
   touch ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.yourusername.macos-dictate.plist
   ```
3. **Edit the `.plist` File**

   Open the file in a text editor:

   ```bash
   open -e ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.yourusername.macos-dictate.plist
   ```

   Paste the following content:

   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
   <plist version="1.0">
   <dict>
       <key>Label</key>
       <string>com.yourusername.macos-dictate</string>
       <key>ProgramArguments</key>
       <array>
           <string>/bin/bash</string>
           <string>-c</string>
           <string>source /path/to/your/venv/bin/activate && python /path/to/your/dictate.py --model base</string>
       </array>
       <key>RunAtLoad</key>
       <true/>
       <key>KeepAlive</key>
       <true/>
       <key>StandardOutPath</key>
       <string>/tmp/macos-dictate.log</string>
       <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
       <string>/tmp/macos-dictate.error.log</string>
   </dict>
   </plist>
   ```

   **Replace `/path/to/your/venv/bin/activate`** and **`/path/to/your/dictate.py`** with the actual paths.
4. **Load the Launch Agent**

   ```bash
   launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.yourusername.macos-dictate.plist
   ```

**Important Notes:**

- **User Interaction:** Since the script may require user interaction (e.g., pressing the trigger key), ensure it doesn't block the startup process.
- **Logging:** Output and errors are logged to `/tmp/macos-dictate.log` and `/tmp/macos-dictate.error.log` respectively.
- **Unloading the Launch Agent:** To stop the script from running at startup:

  ```bash
  launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.yourusername.macos-dictate.plist
  ```

---

## Configuration

### Change the Trigger Key

To change the key that starts and stops dictation, modify the `keycode` in the `dictate.py` script:

```python
# For example, to use F5 (keycode 96)
if keycode == 96:
    toggle_recording()
    return None  # Suppress the event to prevent system beep
```

Remember to save the file after making changes.

Refer to [macOS Virtual Keycodes](https://eastmanreference.com/complete-list-of-applescript-key-codes) for keycode values.

### Improve Transcription Accuracy

- Use a larger model size (e.g., `small`, `medium`, `large`) when running the script.
- Ensure you're in a quiet environment with minimal background noise.
- Use a high-quality microphone.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Accessibility and Microphone Permissions**
The app will automatically request Accessibility and Microphone permissions on its first run. If permissions are not requested or the app fails to start:

- Go to **System Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Accessibility** and **Microphone**.
- Add the application manually if necessary by clicking the **"+"** button and selecting it.
- **PortAudio Errors:** If you encounter errors related to `PortAudio` or `sounddevice`, ensure that `portaudio` is installed via Homebrew and reinstall `sounddevice`:

  ```bash
  brew install portaudio
  pip uninstall sounddevice
  pip install sounddevice
  ```
- **No Text Pasted:** Ensure the active application accepts paste commands and is not blocking automated inputs.
- **Script Not Running at Startup:** Check the contents of your `.plist` file for correctness and verify that the paths are accurate.
- **Application Not Opening:** If the application created via AppleScript or Automator doesn't open, ensure that the script paths are correct and that you have execution permissions.

## Planned Future Features

We're constantly working to improve the macOS Dictation Tool. Here are some features we're planning to implement in future updates:

- [X] Fixed added space at beginning of every transcription
- [X] App now runs in the background with different permissions, terminal does not open
- [X] PID process cleanup logic added to prevent memory leaks
- [X] Allows changing input mic source without breaking the audio input source and requiring to restart the script/app - this solves an issue with MacOS's built-in dictation feature for over a decade
- [X] Add back the indicator for recording and recording stopped
- [ ] (delayed) Responsive cursor updates for certain keywords like "New Line" or "New Paragraph"
  - Tested, not good enough yet for production
- [ ] Custom voice commands for text formatting (e.g., "Bold this", "Italicize that")
- [ ] Real-time transcription display with on-the-fly editing
- [ ] Better UI/UX for dictation settings including always-on-top indicator and top-bar icon
- [ ] Extended punctuation auto-correction and smart capitalization abilities
- [ ] Multi-language support with language detection
- [ ] User-defined custom vocabulary and acronym expansion
- [ ] Voice-activated undo and redo functionality
- [ ] Master log of all dictations saved to file for any use: training on your own speech patterns, etc.
- [ ] Ignore audio playing when input mic is set to Macbook Pro

We're excited about these upcoming improvements and welcome any suggestions for additional features!
