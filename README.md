## Usage

### Running the Script

Ensure your virtual environment is activated:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Run the script with your desired model size:

```bash
python dictate.py --model base
```

Replace `base` with the desired Whisper model size (`tiny`, `base`, `small`, `medium`, `large`).
The base model is enabled by default if you don't use the `--model` tag.

The base model uses about 400 to 500 megabytes of system RAM. The small model increases that by 400 to 500 mb. Use `Activity Monitor` to monitor RAM & CPU usage to find a model that has no system impact while left running persistenly.

### Start Dictation

-   Press the **F1** key (default trigger key) to start recording (press **fn** + **F1** if you haven't set function keys to override mac controls (the symbols on the function keys like brightness, volume, etc.)).
-   You will receive a notification indicating that recording has started.

### Change Trigger Key

You can customize the trigger key for starting and stopping dictation. For instructions on how to change the trigger key, refer to the [Change the Trigger Key](#change-the-trigger-key) section in the Configuration part of this document.

### Stop Dictation

-   Press the **F1** key (default trigger key) again to stop recording.
-   You will receive a notification indicating that recording has stopped.
-   The transcribed text will be automatically pasted into the active application.

---

## Creating a Clickable Application

You can create an application that you can double-click to start the dictation tool without opening Terminal manually.

### Option 1: Using AppleScript

#### a. Open Script Editor

-   Open **Script Editor** by searching for it in Spotlight (press `Cmd + Space` and type "Script Editor").

#### b. Write the AppleScript

Paste the following script into the editor:

```applescript
-- Prompt the user to choose a Whisper model size
set modelSizes to {"tiny", "base", "small", "medium", "large"}
set defaultModel to "base"
set chosenModel to choose from list modelSizes with prompt "Select Whisper model size:" default items defaultModel

if chosenModel is false then
	display alert "No model selected. Exiting."
	return
end if

set modelSize to item 1 of chosenModel

-- Path to your virtual environment activation script
set venvPath to "/Users/yourusername/path/to/your/venv/bin/activate"

-- Path to your Python script
set scriptPath to "/Users/yourusername/path/to/your/macos-dictate/dictate.py"

-- Build the command to run
set shellCommand to "source " & venvPath & " && python " & scriptPath & " --model " & modelSize

-- Run the command in Terminal
tell application "Terminal"
	activate
	do script shellCommand
end tell
```

#### c. Save the Script as an Application

-   Go to **File** > **Export**.
-   Set **File Format** to **Application**.
-   Name it `Start Dictation`.
-   Choose **Desktop** as the location.
-   Click **Save**.

**Instructions:**

-   When you double click the app executable on your desktop, terminal will open, and dictation is ready to use after you see the falling line post:
    > _"...ting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature._ > _checkpoint = torch.load(fp, map_location=device)"_
-   Ignore any warnings about torch or malicious content via pickle hacks (for now).

## Running the Tool at Startup

You can configure the dictation tool to run automatically when you log in.

**Note:** Be cautious when setting scripts to run at startup. Ensure that the script does not require user interaction at startup, or it may hinder the login process.

### Steps:

1. **Create a Launch Agent**

    Create a property list file (`.plist`) in the `~/Library/LaunchAgents` directory.

2. **Create the `.plist` File**

    Open Terminal and run:

    ```bash
    touch ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.yourusername.macos-dictate.plist
    ```

3. **Edit the `.plist` File**

    Open the file in a text editor:

    ```bash
    open -e ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.yourusername.macos-dictate.plist
    ```

    Paste the following content:

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
    <plist version="1.0">
    <dict>
        <key>Label</key>
        <string>com.yourusername.macos-dictate</string>
        <key>ProgramArguments</key>
        <array>
            <string>/bin/bash</string>
            <string>-c</string>
            <string>source /path/to/your/venv/bin/activate && python /path/to/your/dictate.py --model base</string>
        </array>
        <key>RunAtLoad</key>
        <true/>
        <key>KeepAlive</key>
        <true/>
        <key>StandardOutPath</key>
        <string>/tmp/macos-dictate.log</string>
        <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
        <string>/tmp/macos-dictate.error.log</string>
    </dict>
    </plist>
    ```

    **Replace `/path/to/your/venv/bin/activate`** and **`/path/to/your/dictate.py`** with the actual paths.

4. **Load the Launch Agent**

    ```bash
    launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.yourusername.macos-dictate.plist
    ```

**Important Notes:**

-   **User Interaction:** Since the script may require user interaction (e.g., pressing the trigger key), ensure it doesn't block the startup process.
-   **Logging:** Output and errors are logged to `/tmp/macos-dictate.log` and `/tmp/macos-dictate.error.log` respectively.
-   **Unloading the Launch Agent:** To stop the script from running at startup:

    ```bash
    launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.yourusername.macos-dictate.plist
    ```

---

## Configuration

### Change the Trigger Key

To change the key that starts and stops dictation, modify the `keycode` in the `dictate.py` script:

```python
# For example, to use F5 (keycode 96)
if keycode == 96:
    toggle_recording()
    return None  # Suppress the event to prevent system beep
```

Remember to save the file after making changes.

Refer to [macOS Virtual Keycodes](https://eastmanreference.com/complete-list-of-applescript-key-codes) for keycode values.

### Improve Transcription Accuracy

-   Use a larger model size (e.g., `small`, `medium`, `large`) when running the script.
-   Ensure you're in a quiet environment with minimal background noise.
-   Use a high-quality microphone.

---

## Troubleshooting

-   **Accessibility Permissions:** Ensure your Terminal application or Python interpreter has the necessary permissions under **System Preferences** > **Security & Privacy** > **Privacy**.

-   **Microphone Permissions:** Ensure your Terminal application or Python interpreter is allowed to access the microphone.

-   **PortAudio Errors:** If you encounter errors related to `PortAudio` or `sounddevice`, ensure that `portaudio` is installed via Homebrew and reinstall `sounddevice`:

    ```bash
    brew install portaudio
    pip uninstall sounddevice
    pip install sounddevice
    ```

-   **No Text Pasted:** Ensure the active application accepts paste commands and is not blocking automated inputs.

-   **Script Not Running at Startup:** Check the contents of your `.plist` file for correctness and verify that the paths are accurate.

-   **Application Not Opening:** If the application created via AppleScript or Automator doesn't open, ensure that the script paths are correct and that you have execution permissions.
